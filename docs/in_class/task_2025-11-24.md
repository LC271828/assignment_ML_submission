# In-Class Assignment Tasks (2025-11-24)

Source: Classroom slide ("Today's assignment" + notes).

## Today's Assignment
1. Write a **background** and **research objective** based on the problem from the last assignment.
2. **Describe features** of your data (list each column, type, rationale).
3. Identify which **supervised** and **unsupervised** algorithms you will use to solve the problem.
4. **Demonstrate step by step** how one chosen **unsupervised algorithm** works on your data using **at least five data samples**.
   - Handwritten note: "in the manual calculation" → perform a manual (by-hand) walkthrough rather than only code output.
   - Handwritten note: Algorithms mentioned: **K-Means**, **Hierarchical** (choose one for the manual demo).

## Next Week
- Presentation: **Implementation Result + Evaluation Model Result**.

## Suggested Breakdown
| Task | Owner | Deliverable | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|-------|
| Background & Objective | | Paragraph(s) linking problem to ML approach | Reference prior assignment problem statement |
| Data Feature Description | | Table listing feature name, type, role (feature/target) | Align with supervised vs unsupervised usage |
| Algorithm Selection | | Short justification (why chosen supervised + unsupervised methods) | Mention alternative algorithms considered |
| Manual Unsupervised Walkthrough | | Stepwise K-Means or Hierarchical clustering on 5 sample rows | Show distance computations, centroid updates / linkage steps |
| Prep for Presentation | | Slides outline (problem, data, method, results, evaluation) | Include metrics for supervised, silhouette/davies-bouldin for unsupervised |

## Manual Unsupervised Demo Guidance
If choosing **K-Means**:
1. Select 5 sample rows (keep columns numeric; encode categorical if needed).
2. Choose k (e.g., k=2 or k=3 for simplicity).
3. Initialize centroids (randomly pick points or simple min/max).
4. Compute Euclidean distance from each point to each centroid (show table).
5. Assign clusters based on minimum distance.
6. Recompute centroids (mean of assigned points).
7. Repeat steps 4–6 once more; show stabilization or change.
8. Interpret clusters (behavior patterns).

If choosing **Hierarchical**:
1. Compute pairwise distance matrix among 5 points.
2. Find closest pair → merge.
3. Update distances (single/complete/average linkage—state which).
4. Repeat until one cluster; illustrate dendrogram structure.
5. Choose a cut-level; interpret resulting groups.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised Clarification
- Supervised target (choose ONE): e.g. `mental_health_score` (or derive categories). Others (stress/anxiety/depression/sleep_quality) treated as auxiliary or ignored.
- Unsupervised feature set: all behavioral + lifestyle numeric features excluding the chosen target; encode `location_type` if used.

## Evaluation Planning (Next Week)
- Supervised: Train simple baseline (e.g., K-NN or Decision Tree); report accuracy / MAE; compare to naive baseline.
- Unsupervised: Report cluster interpretability + silhouette score; optionally visualize (PCA scatter plot).

## Appendix: Manual K-Means (2 Features, 5 Samples)
This "handwritten" style example uses ONLY two numeric features for clarity:
1. `daily_screen_time_hours` (Screen)
2. `sleep_duration_hours` (Sleep)

### Sample Data (5 Students)
| Student | Screen (h) | Sleep (h) |
|---------|-----------:|----------:|
| A       | 5          | 7         |
| B       | 10         | 5         |
| C       | 2          | 8         |
| D       | 8          | 6         |
| E       | 3          | 7         |

We choose K = 2.

### Step 1. Initialize Centroids
Pick two actual points:
- C1 = A = (5, 7)
- C2 = B = (10, 5)

### Step 2. Compute Euclidean Distances
Formula (2D): 
\( d((x,y),(a,b)) = \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} \)


| Student | d to C1 | d to C2 | Cluster (nearest) |
|---------|--------:|--------:|-------------------|
| A (5,7) | 0.00    | sqrt(29)=5.39 | C1 |
| B (10,5)| 5.39    | 0.00    | C2 |
| C (2,8) | sqrt(10)=3.16 | sqrt(73)=8.54 | C1 |
| D (8,6) | sqrt(10)=3.16 | sqrt(5)=2.24 | C2 |
| E (3,7) | 2.00    | sqrt(53)=7.28 | C1 |

Cluster assignments after first pass:
- Cluster 1: A, C, E
- Cluster 2: B, D

### Step 3. Recompute Centroids
Cluster 1 (A, C, E):
- Screen mean = (5 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 3.33
- Sleep mean  = (7 + 8 + 7) / 3 = 7.33
New C1' ≈ (3.33, 7.33)

Cluster 2 (B, D):
- Screen mean = (10 + 8) / 2 = 9.00
- Sleep mean  = (5 + 6) / 2 = 5.50
New C2' = (9.00, 5.50)

### Step 4. Second Assignment Check (Convergence)
Recalculate distance for A as an example:
\( d(A, C1') = \sqrt{(5-3.33)^2 + (7-7.33)^2} = \sqrt{1.67^2 + (-0.33)^2} \approx \sqrt{2.78 + 0.11} = \sqrt{2.89} = 1.70 \)
\( d(A, C2') = \sqrt{(5-9)^2 + (7-5.5)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 2.25} = \sqrt{18.25} = 4.27 \)
A remains in Cluster 1. (You can verify others similarly; all assignments stay the same.) Algorithm converged in one iteration for this tiny set.

### Step 5. Interpret Clusters
- Cluster 1 (Lower screen time, higher sleep): Potentially healthier digital balance.
- Cluster 2 (Higher screen time, lower sleep): Potential risk group for reduced recovery/sleep hygiene.

### Summary (Hand Calculation Essentials)
1. Select points & K.
2. Initialize centroids (often random or from data points).
3. Compute distances & assign clusters.
4. Recompute centroids as mean of assigned points.
5. Repeat until assignments stabilize (no change) or max iterations reached.

> This manual 2-feature illustration should accompany the 3-feature version if the instructor requests explicit numeric calculations.
